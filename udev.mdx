## How to Set Up uDev:

To set up uDev, firstly you must create a uDev account by registering with [Google, Discord or an alternative email provider](/uxento-vision). Once you have completed registering via your preferred gateway, uDev will generate a developer wallet and a private key. 

<Note>**Please ensure to save your private key securely as you won't be able to access it again.**</Note>
In order to launch coins via uDev, you will need to load this wallet with a small amount of SOL to cover necessary dev fees. 

_The minimum recommended amount is 0.1 SOL, which will cover both fees and allow you to buy a small allocation of your coin._


You can also manage and import your own wallets into uDev, to learn how to do so click here.
