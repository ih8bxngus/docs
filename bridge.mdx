## Swap Between SOL/BNB via Bridge:

You can use Bridge to seamlessly exchange between SOL and BNB. 

To do this, simply input the amount of SOL/BNB you wish to exchange, as well as the wallet you wish to receive your currency into *(by default, Bridge will auto-populate this field with your default wallet on the selected chain)* and click **Create Bridge.** 

Bridge will automatically use the funds in your attached wallet/s to fund the transfer; Within minutes, your requested currency will arrive in your receiving wallet. 

Within the Bridge Panel, you will also have an overview of all your attached wallets, you may use any of these to bridge currencies.
