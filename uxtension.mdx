  <Accordion title="CA Tracker" icon="magnifying-glass">
    The CA Tracker in uxtension drastically enhances your ability to rapidly access real-time alpha.

    Once installing the extension, you'll see these (highlighted in red) additions to your pulse page.

<Frame caption="Uxtension Refresh Button">
  <img 
    src="/images/uxt1.png" 
    alt="Udev Overview"
    style={{
      width: '400%',
      borderRadius: '12px',
      display: 'block',
      margin: '0 auto'
    }}
  />
</Frame>

    **But the main addition you'll see with the coins on your Pulse page is "Groups":**

    <Frame caption="Active Groups">
  <img 
    src="/images/uxt2.jpg"
    alt="Udev Overview"
    style={{
      width: '400%',
      borderRadius: '12px',
      display: 'block',
      margin: '0 auto'
    }}
  />
</Frame>

    This shows which groups have had the CA of the coin posted in them within their **paid-subscription-gated alpha chats.**

    It can be used to efficiently detect which coins are runners (especially when meta-based duplicates are being launched), and can help detect real volume against fake volume.
    
    **We only track subscription-gated chats, meaning only paid members of these groups can post contract addresses which show on our tracker.**

    style={{
      width: '100%',
      maxWidth: '800px',

      margin: '0 auto'
    }}
  />

    We monitor Telegram channels/groups as well, but they have no image icons, and have to be identified by hovering over their simple text icons (alpha is posted way less often in Telegram, as we only monitor channels where the owners/admins themselves can post).
